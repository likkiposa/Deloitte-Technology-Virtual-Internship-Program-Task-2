# Deloitte-Technology-Virtual-Internship-Program-Task-2
Daikibo's tech team has converted all telemetry data collected from the 4 factories of the company:

Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)

Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)

Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)

Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)

Each location has 9 types of machines, sending a message every 10 min. Daikibo has been collecting this data for 1 month (May 2021) and they've just shared this data in the form of a single JSON file. The reason this client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:

In which location did machines break the most?

What are the machines that broke most often in that location?

By completing this task, I learned how to use the famous Analytics tool Tableau to build an interactive dashboard that helps the Daikibo's tech team to answer their questions.
